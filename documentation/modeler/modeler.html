      <p><b>Modeler/Viewer</b></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Model View graphically
displays tables as well as their relationships to other tables. The
Model View is divided into two panes. The right pane contains a list of
all tables that are currently being modeled (prototype tables) as well
as all user defined links. The left pane graphically displays tables
and their relationships. You can create multiple views in this pane.
Existing tables are colored light blue. Prototype tables are colored
yellow.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Existings tables can be added to
the view by drag and drop (or copy/paste) from the Table View as well
as by invoking the add table dialog. Additionally, users may create new
tables (prototype tables) in this view. A prototype table can be
created by invoking the New Table button on the toolbar. This will
display the Table Properties dialog which you can use to define the
columns for the table. Currently, Abeille does not support defining
constraints for table columns. Once a prototype table has been created,
it will be visible in the Prototypes list in the left pane. To save the
table to the database, you should select the prototype in the view and
press the commit button on the toolbar. If you want delete the
prototype without saving, right click on the table in the prototype
list and select the delete menu item.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Models can be saved to external
files.&nbsp; Abeille also has the ability to share model files between
connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Relationships between tables are
indicated by a link connecting the two tables in the view. If the link
is a solid line, then that relationship is based on a foreign key
constraint. If the link is a dashed line, then that link is a
user-defined link. If a link is dragged between two tables that exist
in the database, a user link is created in the application. A user link
is useful if you wish to display a relationship between two tables that
don't have the relationship (foreign key) defined in the database.
Also, some versions of MySQL do not support foreign keys, so user links
would be useful here. User links also are supported in Table Form views
and the Query Builder.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Iif a link is dragged to a
prototype table (i.e. a table that is curren being modeled), a foreign
key is automatically defined in the prototype.</p>
