the result set from a query. In this view you can sort the columns,
reorder the columns, split vertically or horizontally, and export the
results. If the data is from a single table and that table has a
primary key, you can also delete a range of results.</p>

      <p><b>Sorting</b></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">You can sort each column by
clicking on the column header. You can sort in ascending or descending
order. The sort mode is cycled by clicking on the header multiple
times. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Note that for large result sets,
Abeille does not download everything at once. This is denoted by a +
sign after the row count in the status bar. When you see this, it means
that Abeille has not reached the last row in the result set and
therefore, cannot determine the exact size of the result set. When
sorting, you should make sure all data has been retreived by clicking
the move last button on the toolbar.</p>

define the type of delimiter for the text value. The default is a
single quote. You can also select double quotes or no delimiter. If the
SQL checkbox is selected, quote characters are duplicated in those text
values that have quotes. For example, the string , <i>Sandy's email</i>,
would be exported as <i>'Sandy''s'</i> email.</td>

that you wish to be prepended or appended to each row that is exported.
The actual row is denoted by $line. For example, you could generate SQL
insert statements from an export by providing a line decorator such as:</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> insert into mytable (col1,
col2, ... ) values ( <b>$line</b> );</p>

            <td width="643">The Column Options table allows you to
change the order of each column in the output. You can also change the
format of how each column is exported. If a column is a text type in
the result set, the Text check box will be selected in the table. You
can manually check or uncheck this box to require the export to include
text delimiters on the exported value. The Include checkbox controls
whether the selected column is included in the output. Additionally,
you can provide a decorator on the column value. This works in exactly
the same way as the line decorated. The only difference is that the
column values are denoted by $value.</td>
