joins. If you wish to use advanced SQL constructs such as outer joins,
you must use the SQL editor.</p>

      <p align="left" >The query builder
will allow you to type anything in the constraint view. However, if the
constraint does not follow the above format, you should manually
include the constraint in the reportables view. The reason is because
if Abeille is unable to parse your constraints, it will not be able to
determine the tables for those constraints (and the joins might not be
correctly determined). </p>
      <p align="left" >When generating the
SQL for a query, Abeille uses the minimum number of tables possible.
For example, if you have 10 tables in the model view, but use only 2 of
those tables as reportables and constraints, Abeille may or may not
include the other 8 tables. It depends entirely on the relationships
between the tables.The reason for this is because we want you to be
able to see all of the relationships, but still be able to zero in and
query on a particular relationship in the graph. For complicated models
it may be necessary to manually exclude tables from the SQL generation.
Simply select the table and hit the <b>CTRL-E</b> key. To include an
excluded table, select the table and press the <b>i</b> key.</p>
      <p align="left" >The reportable column
view displays all columns that will be returned from the query. This is

column2, ..., columnN from table where ...</p>
